# Machine_Learning-UK_Accident_Severity
Insurance is a risk-management technique used for hedging against various uncertain losses. It involves a contractual agreement between two parties in which one party promises to protect another party from uncertainties and losses.

The objective is to build a model that predicts the severity rating of vehicle accidents in the UK. This would allow the business to determine the degree of accident severity per demography and geographical location within the UK and how much premium should be paid.

We will use data from the UK Government website: https://data.gov.uk/dataset/cb7ae6f0-4be6-4935-9277-47e5ce24a11f/road-safety-data
